Java software radio based on FUNcube Dongle

For those who don't already know.. I'm part of the FUNcube satellite software team,
and this is a port of our original telemetry decoder logic, including software-defined
radio techniques for demodulating raw IQ input from a FUNcube Dongle (or other IQ
receiver) to baseband bits, then the decoding of AO-40 data packets with error
correction bits, courtesy of James Miller and Phil Karn's original C code, as used
in the official Dashboard software.

It's all very experimental.. and unofficial.

## Build
```
./gradlew build
```
## Run
```
./gradlew run
```

## Refactoring plans..

Time to clean up my act :)

 * Break up jsdr.java, introduce some interfaces for:
   * Configuration I/O
   * Audio I/O
   * Logging
   * UI setup (menus, hot keys)
 * Introduce dynamic config (menu/dialogs) for audio input.
 * Improve UI design through use of menus + put hotkey list in a help popup
 * Remove unused audio I/O from FCD.java, add other FCD controls.
 * Waterfall display (in recovered space from hotkey list)!
 * Break up FUNcubeBPSKdemod.java, display/debug & actual demod
 * Move auto-tuning into a separate module (cf: Linux decoder)
